# Frictionless Sales Taxes

This is currently a conceptual DAPP that helps business owners keep track of sales taxes for online sales across multiple states and countries. A wallet will hold the taxes until the taxes are ready to be submitted to the specific businesses. A smart contract with an incorporated tax tracker will determine what percentage of the taxes go to each location from each transaction.
